Write and design a program as per the given instructions: 

Create a class ‘Cards’ and define suitable class variables for it. 
Create a class ‘ClassicGame’ and define suitable class variables for it. 
The function of the class ‘ClassicGame’ name game will take two cards as input and compare them.
First, compare the values on the cards; the player having higher number on the card will win the game. For example, the card having the number 2 will lose to the card having the number 3. 
If the numbers on the cards are the same, compare the suits of the two cards. The suits in order of priority are: 
Spades > Diamond > Hearts > Clubs 
Increase the point of the winner card by 1 and print the scores.
